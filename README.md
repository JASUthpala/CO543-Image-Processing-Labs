# Image Processing Lab Notebooks - CO543 (2025)

**Department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya**  
**Course:** CO543 - Image Processing  
**Labs** 
**Author:** Sandali Uthpala  

This repository contains my **Image Processing laboratory work** implemented in **Jupyter Notebooks**. The notebooks cover hands-on exercises exploring fundamental image processing concepts, pixel-space operations, and illumination/contrast adjustments using Python and OpenCV.

---

## Lab 1: Seeing Images as Numbers & Understanding Basic Transformations
- Visualizing images as numeric arrays  
- Grayscale conversion and structure inspection  
- Image resizing and zoom to study resolution effects  
- Cropping, flipping, and rotation transformations  
- Pixel intensity inversion (negative images)  
- Converting CSV digit data to images  
- Simple affine transformations  
**Focus:** Understanding how computers represent and manipulate images at the pixel level.

## Lab 2: Illumination, Contrast & Thresholding Fundamentals
- Visualizing intensity distributions & histograms  
- Manual thresholding and failure cases  
- Otsu and adaptive thresholding  
- Gamma correction & log transformations  
- Contrast stretching & histogram equalization  
- Bit-plane slicing  
**Focus:** Enhancing and normalizing images under varying lighting conditions, and understanding the effect of intensity transformations on perception and segmentation.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (.ipynb)  
- **OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib**
